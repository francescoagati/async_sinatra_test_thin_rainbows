An example of performance with async_sinatra with thin and rainbows.

class AsyncTest < Sinatra::Base
  register Sinatra::Async

  enable :show_exceptions


  get '/test_sync' do
    "prova"
  end

  aget '/test_async' do 
    body { ["prova async"] }
  end
  
end

with rainbow and 4 worker_processes i obtain:

Requests per second:    805.41 [#/sec] (mean)
Time per request:       124.16 [ms] (mean)
Time per request:       1.24 [ms] (mean, across all concurrent requests)
Transfer rate:          95.10 [Kbytes/sec] received

with thin and one worker i obtain;

Requests per second:    1747.95 [#/sec] (mean)
Time per request:       57.21 [ms] (mean)
Time per request:       0.57 [ms] (mean, across all concurrent requests)
Transfer rate:          183.53 [Kbytes/sec] received

How can be possible this? What difference have thin and rainbows with eventmachine? I have also test
rainbows with one worker but this with only one worker is really fast.



RAINBOW

worker_processes 4

Rainbows! do
    use :EventMachine
    worker_connections 400
    client_max_body_size nil
    keepalive_timeout 0
end
